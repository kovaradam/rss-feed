# Web Journal ðŸ“–

Easy-going RSS feed.

- Uses [does-it-rss](https://does-it-rss.com), which was extracted from this app as a standalone service.
- Built with Remix/SQlite.

## Development

- Install dependencies

  ```sh
  npm i
  ```

- Create `.env` file based on `env.example`

  ```sh
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

- Setup database:

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates new users with some data you can use to get started:

- Email: `rachel@remix.run`
- Password: `racheliscool`

Admin user (.env.example config):

- Email: `admin@web.journal`
- Password: `adminiscool`
